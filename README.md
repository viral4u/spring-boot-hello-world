# Note for Renovate Team
This service is configured to be compatible with Java Runtime 1.8 (pom.xml version file)
<br>
**Acutual Behaviour**
<br>

Pull request created that recommends Spring Boot version 2.7.17 -> 3.2.0.
Spring Boot 3.2.0 requires minimum Java 17. Hence this recommendation is not correct.
<br>

**Expected Behaviour**
Recommended version should consider service's Java Runtime before recommending upgrade.  
Also it would be ideal if it combines Java runtime upgrade and dependency upgrade together but this will be very major change.

# Spring Boot Hello World

**A simple Spring Boot 2.x app to send hello world message to a user**

## How to Run Application

**Start the application using any of the commands mentioned below**

> **Note:** First two commands need to run inside the root folder of this project i.e inside the **spring-boot-hello-world** folder


- **Using maven** <br/>``` mvn spring-boot:run```


- **From jar file**
  Create a jar file using '**mvn clean install**' command and then execute
  <br/>```java -jar target/spring-boot-2-hello-world-1.0.2-SNAPSHOT.jar```


- **Directly from IDE**
  <br/>```Right click on HelloWorldApplication.java and click on 'Run' option```
  <br/><br/>

> **Note:** By default spring boot application starts on port number 8080. If port 8080 is occupied in your system then you can change the port number by uncommenting and updating the **server.port** property inside the **application.properties** file that is available inside the **src > main > resources** folder.

<br/>

- **Browser or REST client**
  <br/>```http://localhost:8080/hello```


- **cURL**
  <br/>```curl --request GET 'http://localhost:8080/hello'```


## How to Run Unit Test Cases

**Run the test cases using any of the commands mentioned below**

> **Note:** These commands need to run inside the root folder of this project i.e inside the **spring-boot-hello-world** folder

- **To run all the test cases**
  <br/>```mvn test```


- **To run a particular test class**
  <br/>```mvn -Dtest=HelloWorldControllerTest test```
  <br/>or
  <br/>```mvn -Dtest=HelloWorldApplicationTests test```
